        <p class="text-center">In accordance with the delegation of authority granted to the governing authority of Weber State University, contained in Section 53B-3-103, Utah State Code Annotated, parking and traffic rules and regulations are adopted. All staff, students, and visitors operating vehicles on campus are required to comply with the WSU Parking Rules and Regulations.</p>

        <p class="text-center">The purpose of the rules and regulations is to provide an orderly method for the formulation, adoption and enforcement of parking and traffic regulations on Weber State University campuses, and to provide an equitable method for their enforcement. A motor vehicle found in violation of the rules and regulations is presumed to have been parked by the registered owner, or the person who registered the vehicle with Parking Services. Penalties arising from vehicles found in violation are the responsibility of the registered owner.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Tips to Avoid a Parking Ticket</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Permits are required in all lots on campus Monday&ndash;Friday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. except at the Dee Events Center.</li>
            <li>Be sure to verify that the license plate(s) registered on your permit is/are accurately entered (careful to enter a zero and not an O if applicable).</li>
            <li>Park so that the license plate is visible from the travel lane. If you don&rsquo;t have a front plate, don&rsquo;t pull through a parking space.</li>
            <li>Check the box next to the vehicle you want active on your permit. Only one license plate may be active on permit at a time.</li>
            <li>Faculty/staff may have two plates active under permit but only one vehicle may be parked on campus at a given time.</li>
        </ul>
